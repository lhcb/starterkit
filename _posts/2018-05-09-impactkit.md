The Impactkit is a three-day course in which participants follow advanced
lectures and get a chance to obtain some hands-on experience on the LHCb
software. Projects are proposed, and in addition participants are encouraged to
bring their own problems to the table. This year it will take place between
the 9th and 11th May.

Registration via the [Indico page]({{ page.indico }}) will be made available
closer to the event after being announced on the [`lhcb-general`][lhcb-general]
mailing list.

If you have any suggestions for project ideas please make a comment on the
[GitHub issue][project-ideas-issue] or contact the organisers by
[email][starterkit-email].
