The Impactkit is a three-day course in which participants follow advanced
lectures and get a chance to obtain some hands-on experience on the LHCb
software. Projects are proposed, and in addition participants are encouraged to
bring their own problems to the table. The third edition took place between
the 9th and 11th May 2018.
