The first ever LHCb Starterkit took place at CERN from 2nd to 5th of June 2015.
Two weeks after registration opened, 40 people had already signed up and the
Starterkit was booked out. It was organised by Tim Head and Kevin Dungs with
the help of Igor Babuschkin, and Albert Puig Navarro. The workshop was split in
two parts: Two days of Software Carpentry as taught by Rémi Emonet, Kwasi
Kwakwa, and Chelsea Chisholm plus two days of LHCb specific software tutorials.


## Material

 * The [Indico event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/376901/) contains a timetable as well as further links to the material.
 * The [Software Carpentry event page](http://twitwi.github.io/2015-06-02-cern-lhcb/) was created by the SWC instructors and contains detailed information concerning their half of the workshop.
 * The [first-analysis-steps material page](https://lhcb.github.io/first-analysis-steps/) contains the material that was used during the second part of the workshop. It has been updated since then. The state of the material as it was during the workshop can be found in [the Git repository](https://github.com/lhcb/first-analysis-steps/tree/6b20db95b4a87955e3ca3262867ba4e1ac66dbdf)

## Social event

As part of the first Starterkit there was a social event: BBQ at the LHCb
experiment. Thanks to all the helpers and most importantly the grill champion
Conor it was a huge success.
