The fifth edition of LHCb Starterkit took place from the 26th to 30th of November 2018 at CERN.
We once again taught the fundamentals of the LHCb software, as well as useful
basics like Bash, Git and Python to about 50 Masters and PhD students from LHCb.
Additionally, this year there was 30 students from ALICE and 10 students from SHiP collaborations joining for the
first two days.
