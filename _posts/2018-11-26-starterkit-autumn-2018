Fasten your seatbelts once more! The LHCb Starterkit is taking off for the
fifth time!
This year's Starterkit will be held from the 26th to 30th of November 2018 at CERN.

Registration is now open! You can find all necessary information, including the
registration form on [the Indico page for the event][indico].

The LHCb Starterkit is a yearly workshop designed to teach new students at LHCb
the computing skills they need to become effective researchers. This year, we
will once again teach the fundamentals of the LHCb software, as well as useful
basics like Bash, Git and Python to 45 Masters and PhD students from LHCb.

Additionally this year there will be 30 students from ALICE and 10 students from SHiP collaborations joining for the
first two days.

The deadline to register is the 15th of November at 15:00h. We expect the event to
be very popular, so please make sure to register as soon as possible. Spots will
be assigned on a first-come first-served basis. The registration fee of CHF 25
needs to be paid to the LHCb secretariat in advance of the workshop. It will be
used to finance coffee breaks and a social event.

Should you have any further questions, you can contact us [by email][email].

Please keep in mind that this event is specifically designed for early PhD
students, or advanced Masters students. If you are not sure whether the
Starterkit is at an appropriate level for you, you can have a look at
[last year's lessons][first-ana-steps].

If you are taking on new PhD students this year, please consider bringing this
workshop to their attention or registering on their behalf if they will be
starting in the coming weeks.
