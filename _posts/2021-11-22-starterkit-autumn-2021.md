The LHCb Starterkit is back for the 2021 edition! 
This year's Starterkit will be held from the 22nd to 26th of November 2021 in online format with the possibility of having some rooms booked at CERN.

Registration opens on October the 1st! You can find all necessary information, including the

The LHCb Starterkit is a yearly workshop designed to teach new students at LHCb
the computing skills they need to become effective researchers. The core of the workshop are fundamental LHCb analysis tools, like DaVinci or AnalysisProductions.  
This year, we extending the tutorials to also cover some of the upcoming Run3 tools!
As usual we start with teaching the basics like Bash, Git and Python to Masters and PhD students of LHCb.

Should you have any further questions, you can contact us [by email][email].

Please keep in mind that this event is specifically designed for early PhD
students, or advanced Masters students. If you are not sure whether the
Starterkit is at an appropriate level for you, you can have a look at
[last year's lessons][first-ana-steps].

If you are taking on new PhD students this year, please consider bringing this
workshop to their attention or registering on their behalf if they will be
starting in the coming weeks.
